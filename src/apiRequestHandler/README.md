###  API Request Handler

## Concept

Develop a system for managing various API request handlers, such as GETHandler, POSTHandler, etc., utilizing an API Handler Factory. This approach allows the management and execution of different API request types in a streamlined and modular manner.

## Usefulness

- **Simplified API Request Handling:** Handles various API request types by decoupling the client code from specific handler implementations.
- **Modular Approach:** Ensures each request type is managed by its dedicated handler, promoting a clean and organized codebase.
- **Flexible Request Management:** Easily introduce and manage new API request types through a unified API Handler Factory.

## Usage

### Making API Requests

Creating and handling API requests is simplified and modularized. Specify the type of request and its options, and let the dedicated handler manage the request:

```typescript
import { APIHandlerFactory, HandlerOptions } from "./api";

const apiFactory = new APIHandlerFactory();

const getOptions: HandlerOptions = {
  type: "GET",
  url: "https://api.example.com/data",
  headers: {
    Accept: "application/json",
  },
};

const getHandler = apiFactory.createHandler(getOptions);
getHandler.handleRequest();

interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const postOptions: HandlerOptions<User> = {
  type: "POST",
  url: "https://api.example.com/user",
  body: {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
  },
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
};

const postHandler = apiFactory.createHandler(postOptions);
postHandler.handleRequest();
```

### Extending with New Request Types

To introduce new request types, define their properties and behaviors in `api.ts` and extend the `APIHandlerFactory` to support the new type.

## Code Structure

- **`api.ts`**
  - Contains the core logic for defining, creating, and handling API requests.
  - `RequestHandler`: Interface defining the basic structure of a request handler.
  - `GETHandler` and `POSTHandler`: Classes that implement the `RequestHandler` interface for handling GET and POST requests, respectively.
  - `APIHandlerFactory`: Class containing the main factory method for creating request handlers based on specified options.
- **`client.ts`**
  - Demonstrates how to utilize the API request handler system to make various types of API requests.

## Future Improvements

- **Advanced Error Handling:** Implement more advanced error handling and retry mechanisms for API requests.
- **Request Cancellation:** Introduce the ability to cancel ongoing API requests.
- **Request Queueing:** Develop a system to queue and manage concurrent API requests to avoid potential rate limiting.
