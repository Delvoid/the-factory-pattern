# Payment System 

## Concept

Build a robust and flexible payment system that allows users to make payments through different methods (such as PayPal, Credit Card, and Bank Transfer) using a Payment Factory.

## Usefulness

- **Versatile Payment Options:** Offer multiple payment methods through a unified, consistent interface to cater to various user preferences.
- **Secure and Validated Transactions:** Centralize the validation and processing of payment data, ensuring secure and accurate transactions.
- **Easily Expandable:** Facilitates the addition of new payment methods without requiring modifications to the existing client code.

## Usage

### Making a Payment

Payments can be made by specifying the method, amount, and relevant payment details, offering an uncomplicated client interface for various payment methods:

```typescript
import { makePayment } from "./payment";

makePayment("CreditCard", 100, {
  cardNumber: "1234-5678-9012-3456",
  expiryDate: new Date("2025-01-01"),
  cvv: "123",
});
```

### Adding New Payment Methods

To incorporate additional payment methods:

- Define their respective properties and behaviors in `payment.ts`.
- Expand the `createPaymentMethod` function to recognize the new method.

## Code Structure

- **`payment.ts`**
  - Houses the core logic for payment method definition, creation, and transaction processing.
  - `Payment`: Interface delineating the basic structure of a payment method.
  - `createPaymentMethod`: A factory function for generating payment methods of specified types.
  - `makePayment`: A function orchestrating the payment process using the designated payment method.
- **`client.ts`**
  - Demonstrates utilizing the payment system to conduct transactions using diverse methods.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Security Mechanisms:** Implement advanced security protocols for safeguarding sensitive payment data.
- **Dynamic Currency Conversion:** Introduce logic to process payments in various currencies and convert between them as needed.
- **Integration with Payment APIs:** Embed actual logic to facilitate transactions via payment APIs or other mechanisms in the respective payment method classes.
