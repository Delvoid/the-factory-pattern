# Factory Pattern Examples in TypeScript

This repository provides a collection of practical examples illustrating the implementation and usage of the Factory Pattern in TypeScript. The Factory Pattern is a versatile design pattern that simplifies object creation, by providing a method that acts as a “factory” for creating objects. It abstracts the instantiation process, allowing the type of object created to be determined at runtime.

## Key Benefits of the Factory Pattern

- **Flexible Object Creation:** Facilitates the creation of objects, allowing for instantiation logic to be defined in subclasses or configuration.
- **Decoupling:** Separates object creation from its usage in client code, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.
- **Extensibility:** Enables the easy addition of new classes and creation logic without altering existing code.
- **Manageable Complexity:** Organizes and simplifies client code, especially when multiple constructors or configurations are involved.

## Examples Overview

### [1. Pizza Ordering System](src/pizza/README.md)

- **Concept**: Create different types of pizzas using a Pizza Factory.
- **Usefulness**: Easily introduce new pizza types without modifying existing code.

### [2. Logger System](src/logger/README.md)

- **Concept**: Develop different logger types using a Logger Factory.
- **Usefulness**: Switch between different logging mechanisms without changing client code.


### [3. Theme Manager for UI](src/themeManager/README.md)

- **Concept**: Create different themes using a Theme Factory.
- **Usefulness**: Allows dynamic switching and easy addition of new themes.

### [4. Transport Vehicle Rental System](src/vehicleRental/README.md)

- **Concept**: Create vehicles like Cars, Bikes, or Scooters using a Vehicle Factory.
- **Usefulness**: Easily manage and extend various vehicle types in the rental system.

## Usage

Each example in this repository is structured as a module within its own dedicated folder. However, all examples share a common TypeScript configuration and dependencies, which are defined at the root level of the project.

Here’s how you can run the examples:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone [Your Repository URL]
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the root of the cloned repository and run:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run an Example:**
   Use `ts-node` to run a specific example. Navigate to the respective example folder within the `src` directory, and run the `client.ts` file:
   ```
   npx ts-node src/logger/client.ts
   ```
